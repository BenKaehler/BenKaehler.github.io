It is also critical to our understanding of these systems with important applications in human health. This project would attempt to design and fit stochastic models such as Ornstein-Uhlenbeck or Lévy processes to possibly transformed time series of microbiome composition data, with an emphasis on empirical understanding.</p><h3 id=microbial-dark-matter>Microbial Dark Matter</h3><p>Large-scale public databases surveying genetic diversity of microbial samples allow us to understand the range of diversity that exists in different microbial habitats. At the same time, reference databases attempt to curate and catalogue known microbial species. This project would address the question of how much of the microbial universe is understood, and could take a variety of forms from large-scale metastudies to developing techniques for fitting rich sampling distributions, with a view to better modelling rare or unknown genetic variants.</p><h3 id=non-stationary-phylogenetics>Non-stationary Phylogenetics</h3><p>The field of phylogenetics is beset with model misspecification issues, that can sometimes mean that data can be made to strongly support contradictory positions. One of those issues is that the models that are used are stationary, stochastically speaking. Relaxing that assumption has the potential to resolve controversies in the field, but only if new ways can be found to work with the resulting models. This project would investigate some promising directions in fitting non-stationary models of molecular evolution on large trees.</p><h3 id=hyperbolic-learning-in-biology>Hyperbolic Learning in Biology</h3><p>It turns out that trees, the mathematical objects, can be almost perfectly embedded in hyperbolic spaces. There are many problems in computational biology and bioinformatics that are difficult because discrete trees can be hard to work with. This project would investigate how embedding trees in continuous hyperbolic spaces alleviates bottlenecks that have traditionally hampered efforts to apply machine learning and numerical optimisation techniques. If successful, it would have immediate applications in microbial ecology and phylogenetics generally.</p><hr><h2 id=applying>Applying</h2><p>Check your eligibility or apply at the <a href=https://research.unsw.edu.au/submit-application>UNSW site</a>, but you should probably start by mailing <a href=mailto:b.kaehler@adfa.edu.au>Ben</a>.</p></div></div><div id=footer class=mb-5><hr><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://github.com/BenKaehler class="fab fa-github fa-1x" title=GitHub></a><a href=mailto:b.kaehler@adfa.edu.au class="fas fa-envelope fa-1x" title=E-mail></a></div><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://benkaehler.github.io title="© 2021 Ben Kaehler.
